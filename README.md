# GSPy
A Python set of functions for Graph Signal Processing. No installing needed (yet). Scipy, Numpy and Matplotlib are required.

This file was produced during my Masters degree to allow me to implement some Graph Signal Processing routines, since I was having trouble installing PyGSP (https://github.com/epfl-lts2/pygsp). Some functions need improvement and the code is not yet fully commented. Still working on it. The user is encouraged to also check out the MATLAB toolboxes GSPBOX and GraSP, and of course PyGSP, the library written in Python. Any correction or suggestion is appreciated.
